#  How to Play Poker: What You Need to Know About Starting Hands

For a beginner, the complexities of poker might seem insurmountable. But if you understand the value of starting hands and how to play them, you’re already on your way to becoming a skilled player.

In Texas Holdem, each player is dealt two cards face down, which are known as their hole cards. The remaining cards are placed in the middle of the table, face up — this is known as the flop. The first three community cards are turned over, and players can use any combination of their two hole cards and the five community cards to make the best possible five-card hand.

The player with the best hand at showdown wins the pot. In most cases, simply making any four-of-a-kind or better will win the pot, since there are only four suits and 13 potential card combinations in each (binomial coefficient).

But what about lesser hands? In general, there are three types of starting hands you should be aware of: strong hands, weak hands, and medium hands.

Strong Hands: A strong hand is one that has a high probability of winning on its own. These include sets (three-of-a-kind), straights (five consecutive cards), and flushes (five matching cards of any suit). In most cases, you should never fold a strong hand unless there’s something on the board that significantly improves someone else’s hand (e.g., four out of five cards are hearts).

Weak Hands: A weak hand is one that doesn’t have a high probability of winning on its own. These include two pair or higher (since you need at least one pair to open) and all kinds of unsuited hands (since they won’t make a flush or straight). You can often fold weak hands without much regret; however, if there’s something on the board that gives you hope for a better hand (e.g., two pair or better), then it might be worth staying in to see what happens.

Medium Hands: A medium hand is somewhere in between a strong and weak hand; it has some chance of winning but is not as likely as a strong hand. These include one pair and all unsuited connectors (cards that are connected but not in sequence). Generally speaking, you should play medium hands more aggressively than weak hands; however, if there’s something scary on the board (e.g., an Ace), then it might be wise to fold instead.

#  The Top 5 Poker Hands in Order

1. Royal flush

A royal flush is the best possible hand in poker, and consists of the five highest ranking cards: A, K, Q, J, 10. This hand is incredibly rare, occurring only once in every 64,000 hands on average.

2. Straight flush

A straight flush is a five-card sequence of the same suit. for example, 8♥ 9♥ 10♥ J♥ K♥ would be a straight flush of clubs. These are also quite rare, occurring only once in every 312 hands on average.

3. Four of a kind

Four of a kind is pretty self-explanatory - it's four cards of the same rank. For example, 4♥ 4♦ 4♣ 4♠ would be four aces. This hand occurs about once in every 54 hands on average.

4. Full house

A full house is three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank - for example 5♠ 5♦ 2♦ 2♣ would be a full house of fives. This hand occurs about once in every 6 hands on average.

5. Flush

A flush is any five cards of the same suit - for example, 3♦ 7♦ 10♦ J♦ Q♦ would be a flush of diamonds. This hand occurs about once in every 13 hands on average

#  Poker Strategy: The Importance of Your Starting Hand

It’s no secret that the importance of your starting hand in poker is vital to your success. In fact, the better your starting hand is, the more likely you are to win the pot.

There are a variety of different factors that come into play when considering how strong your starting hand is. The first thing to look at is your position at the table. The later you are in the seating order, the weaker your starting hand will be. This is because there will be more players left to act after you, and they will have better hands than you.

The second factor to look at is the number of players at the table. The more players playing, the weaker your starting hand will be. This is because there will be more cards in play, making it more difficult for you to win the pot.

The third factor to consider is what type of game you are playing. In tournaments, you will want a stronger starting hand than in cash games. This is because in tournaments, there is a lot of money at stake and players are usually less willing to fold their hands.

The fourth factor to consider is what type of player you are up against. If you are playing against tight players, you can afford to have a weaker starting hand than if you were playing against loose players. Tight players are less likely to fold their hands, so you will need a stronger hand to take down the pot.

Now that we’ve gone over some of the factors that determine how strong your starting hand is, let’s take a look at some examples.

In Texas Hold Em, As and 2s are considered two of the weakest possible starting hands. They should only be played if there are few people left to act after you and/or if there are very loose players at the table. If neither of these conditions are met, then it’s best to fold these hands and wait for a better opportunity.


On the other end of the spectrum, Aces and Kings are considered two of the strongest possible starting hands. They should always be played if you have them, regardless of who else is sitting at the table or where you are sitting in relation to them.

#  Choosing the Right Poker Hand: What You Need to Consider

When you’re playing poker, one of the most important things you need to do is make sure you’re picking the right hand to play. If you don’t choose correctly, you could end up losing a lot of money – so it’s important to know what to look for.

Here are a few things you should consider when choosing a hand:

#1 The Number of Opponents

One of the biggest factors to consider when choosing a hand is the number of opponents you’re up against. If there are only a few people at the table, then you can afford to be more aggressive and go for stronger hands. However, if there are more players involved, then you’ll need to be more cautious and stick with safer hands.

#2 Your Position at the Table

Your position at the table also has an impact on which hand you should play. If you’re in early position, then you can afford to be more aggressive since there are fewer players who can respond to your bets. However, if you’re in later position, then it’s wiser to play conservatively and wait for stronger hands.

#3 The Type of Game Being Played

The type of game being played also matters when it comes to choosing a hand. In a cash game, for instance, you can afford to take more risks because there is no set end point – but in tournaments, you have to be more careful because one bad move could mean elimination from the competition.

#4 The Cards You Hold

Ultimately, the cards you hold will determine which hand is best for you. If your cards are strong, then you can afford to be more aggressive; but if they’re weaker, then it might be better to fold and wait for a better opportunity.
