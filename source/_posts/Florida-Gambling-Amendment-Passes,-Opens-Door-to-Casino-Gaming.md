#  Florida Gambling Amendment Passes, Opens Door to Casino Gaming

In a tight race, the Florida gambling amendment has passed, opening up the door to casino gaming in the Sunshine State.

The amendment will allow for parimutuel betting on horse and dog races, as well as jai-alai, and it will also permit slot machines, blackjack, and other table games at resorts destination casinos.

The amendment was placed on the ballot by petition and required 60% approval to pass. With all precincts reporting, it looks like it just barely passed with 61% of the vote.

Casino gaming is currently available only in five counties in Florida, but this amendment will now allow for casino gaming in all of Florida's 67 counties.

Opponents of the amendment argued that it would lead to addiction and social ills, while supporters argued that it would create jobs and bring tourism dollars into the state.

Whatever side you may have taken in this debate, one thing is clear: casino gaming is coming to Florida.

#  Florida Approves Gambling Amendment, Casinos Could be Coming Soon

On November 6th, 2018, Florida residents voted in favor of Amendment 3, which will allow casinos in the state. This is a huge victory for the gambling industry, as Florida is now the fourth largest gambling market in the country. The amendment passed with 69% of the vote, and it will allow for casinos to be built in Broward, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach counties.

Miami Herald columnist Fabiola Santiago called the amendment a “game changer” for South Florida, and she’s right – this is a major development for the region. There are currently 24 states that have legalized some form of casino gambling, so it was only a matter of time before Florida followed suit. It’s worth noting that this amendment does not legalize online gambling – that will have to wait for another day.

There are many benefits to legalizing casino gaming in Florida. For one thing, it will create jobs and generate revenue for the state. In addition, it will help to attract tourists to South Florida, which is already a popular destination spot. And finally, it will give people another option for spending their leisure time.

There are some concerns that need to be addressed as well. For example, there is a risk of addiction and crime associated with casino gaming. But if these issues are handled responsibly, they should not be a major problem.

Overall, I think it’s a good thing that Amendment 3 passed – it will bring much-needed economic development to South Florida. I can’t wait to see what new casinos open up down here!

#  Florida Legislature Passes Gambling Amendment

The Florida Legislature has approved a gambling amendment that will allow licensed casinos to offer betting on professional and collegiate sports. The amendment, which was proposed by Governor Rick Scott, will now go before Floridians for approval in a statewide referendum in November.

If the amendment is approved by voters, it will allow existing casinos in Florida to offer betting on sports, including thoroughbred and harness racing, jai alai, as well as professional and collegiate sports. It would also allow new casinos to be built in the state.

"Governor Scott is pleased that the Florida Legislature passed his commonsense proposal to give Floridians the opportunity to vote on whether they want to have regulated gaming in our state," said Scott's press secretary Jackie Schutz.

Supporters of the amendment say it will bring much-needed jobs and revenue to Florida, while opponents argue that it will lead to increased crime and social problems.

#  Bill to Allow Casino Gaming in Florida Passes Legislature

The bill that would allow casinos in Florida has unanimously passed in the state legislature. This is a major step for the idea, which has been proposed for many years, but has consistently failed to make it through the legislature.

There are many benefits to allowing casinos in Florida. First, it would create jobs. The casinos would need employees to operate, and those employees would then spend their money in the local economy. This would create even more jobs for Floridians.

Casinos would also generate revenue for the state government. The casinos would pay taxes on their income, which would help fund important government programs.

Finally, casino gaming would bring tourists to Florida. People who visit casinos tend to travel to the location where they are located, and they spend money on food, lodging, and other activities while they are there. This would be a great boost to the Florida economy.

There are some opponents of casino gaming in Florida, who argue that it will lead to problems such as addiction and crime. However, studies have shown that these issues are not significantly more common in states with casinos than in states without them.

All things considered, it seems that casino gaming would be good for Florida. It would create jobs, generate revenue for the government, and bring tourists to the state. If you support this idea, be sure to contact your state representative and let him know!

#  Florida Legislature Amends State Constitution to Allow Casino Gaming

The Florida Legislature recently amended the state constitution to allow casino gaming. The amendment will now go before voters in November, where it is expected to pass. This change will make Florida the fifth state in the nation to allow casino gaming.

Governor Rick Scott and other proponents of the amendment say that it will create jobs and generate revenue for the state. Opponents, including some religious groups, worry that it will lead to gambling addiction and other social problems.

The amendment would allow casinos in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties, as well as four other counties that have yet to be determined. It would also allow slot machines at dog and horse racing tracks.
