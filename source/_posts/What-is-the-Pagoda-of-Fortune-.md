#  What is the Pagoda of Fortune? 

The Pagoda of Fortune, also known as the Dragon King’s Pagoda or the Tower of Gold and Jewels, is a Nine-Story tower located in the complex of royal palaces in Beijing. The pagoda was commissioned by Emperor Taizong of Tang Dynasty in 652 AD and completed in 653 AD. 

The pagoda is octagonal in shape with each story consisting of five receding tiers. The first four stories are decorated with gold plaques and carved dragon heads while the upper five stories are covered with green glazed tiles. At the top of the pagoda is a gold spire capped with a jewel. 

The Pagoda of Fortune is not just a beautiful structure but also has an interesting history. According to legend, it was built to store treasures from heaven that were given to Emperor Taizong by the Dragon King. In reality, it was probably used as a treasury to store gold, silver and other valuable items. 

Over time, the Pagoda of Fortune fell into disrepair and its gold plaques were stolen. It was only restored in 1994 and is now one of the most popular tourist attractions in Beijing.

#  How to play the game Pagoda of Fortune

Welcome to the pagoda of fortune! The object of the game is to be the first player to get all their tiles to the pagoda.

To play, each player starts with 21 tiles. The player takes turns flipping over one of their tiles. If the tile has a symbol on it that matches one on another player's tile, the player takes that tile and puts it in front of them. If the symbol doesn't match, the player flips over another tile.

The game continues until either someone gets all their tiles to the pagoda or no more tiles can be flipped because they've all been revealed. In either case, that player wins!
