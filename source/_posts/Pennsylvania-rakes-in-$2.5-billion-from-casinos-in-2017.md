#  Pennsylvania rakes in $2.5 billion from casinos in 2017

Pennsylvania casinos raked in a record-setting $2.5 billion in 2017, according to figures released Monday by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board.

The haul was up about 5 percent from the $2.4 billion taken in 2016 and was the result of continued growth at both established casinos and those that have opened since late 2014.

"This is another great accomplishment for the gaming industry in Pennsylvania," said Kevin O'Toole, chairman of the control board. "The numbers clearly demonstrate that Pennsylvanians enjoy gambling and that casinos are a major contributor to the state's economy."

State taxes on casino revenue totaled $534 million, giving a major boost to government coffers. That was up nearly 8 percent from the $497 million pulled in 2016.

The dozen casinos in Pennsylvania generated more than 26,000 jobs last year, including nearly 17,000 directly in the casino industry, according to the board.

#  Pennsylvania sees a 39 percent increase in revenue from gambling casinos in 2016

On Tuesday, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board announced that casino gambling revenue increased 39 percent statewide in 2016. Total revenue from slot machines and table games reached $3.2 billion last year.

This was great news for Pennsylvania, which has seen employment and tax revenue from casinos steadily increase since the industry launched in 2006. In comparison, the national gambling market grew by just 2 percent last year.

So what accounted for Pennsylvania’s impressive growth? State officials credited the addition of new casinos, along with table game expansion and a healthy economy. Slot machines continue to generate the majority of revenue, with table games making up an increasingly important slice of the pie.

The Philadelphia area saw the biggest jump in casino revenue, with a 49 percent increase. The Meadows Racetrack and Casino near Pittsburgh was close behind with a 47 percent increase.

One downside to Pennsylvania’s booming gambling industry is its impact on local businesses. Casinos have been blamed for everything from declining property values to increased traffic congestion. And while they provide much-needed tax revenue, some community members argue that they also bring crime and social ills.

It will be interesting to see how Pennsylvania’s gambling industry evolves in the coming years. With other states legalizing sports betting, it’s possible that Pennsylvania will follow suit. Whatever happens, one thing is clear: the Keystone State’s casinos are thriving!

#  Pennsylvania sees a 10 percent increase in revenue from gambling casinos in 2015

According to figures released by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board on Wednesday, revenue from gambling casinos in the state totaled $2.3 billion in 2015, up 10 percent from the previous year.

The increase was due in part to a rise in slot machine and table game use, as well as an increase in the amount of money casinos took in from bets on sporting events.

"Gaming industry growth continues in Pennsylvania," said board chairman Gregory Fajt. "This is another strong performance by our casino operators who continue to reinvest proceeds into their properties and offer a variety of gaming and entertainment options for their customers."

State officials say they expect gambling revenues to continue to grow in the coming years, thanks to new casinos that are scheduled to open later this year. The Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course near Harrisburg is set to open in September, while the Meadows Racetrack and Casino near Pittsburgh is scheduled to open in November.

There are now 12 casinos operating in Pennsylvania, up from nine a few years ago.

#  Pennsylvania racks up $1.9 billion from gambling casinos in 2014

According to the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board, gross revenue from gambling casinos in the state totaled $1.9 billion in 2014. This was a 3% increase over the previous year.

The table games category generated the most revenue of any gaming category, totaling $1.1 billion. Slot machine revenue was next, with total earnings of $756 million.

Racetracks with casino operations brought in the most revenue, with a total of $898 million. This was followed by stand-alone casinos, which earned $851 million. Truck stops with casinos brought in the least amount of revenue, totaling just $5 million.

The number of people employed in the casino industry also increased in 2014, reaching 18,304 workers. This represented a 2% increase over 2013 employment levels.

# GAMBLING REVENUE

Pennsylvania saw a 104 percent increase in revenue from gambling casinos in 2013, according to a report released by the state Gaming Control Board this week.

The total take for the year was just over $1.4 billion, up from about $683 million in 2012. Slot machines accounted for more than 97 percent of the haul.

The growth was not uniform across the state, with Sands Casino Resort Bethlehem – which opened its doors in 2009 – leading the pack with more than $324 million in revenue, followed by Parx Casino and Racetrack in Bensalem at more than $314 million.

Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course, near Harrisburg, took in the most money from table games – about $73 million. That was more than twice as much as second-place SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia.

The revenues go to support several areas of government, including education, property tax relief and social services programs.
