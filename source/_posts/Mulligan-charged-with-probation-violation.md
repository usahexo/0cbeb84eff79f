#  Mulligan charged with probation violation

According to court documents, Mulligan is charged with probation violation. If convicted, he faces up to 18 months in prison. The charge stems from a previous conviction for DUI.

Mulligan's attorney released a statement saying that his client remains "committed to doing everything he can to overcome this situation and proving himself worthy of the continued support of his fans."

The 38-year-old Mulligan first gained recognition as a member of the rock band OK Go, which rose to fame in the early 2000s with its quirky music videos. He later pursued a solo career, releasing two albums.

#  Mulligan avoids jail time, ordered to participate in treatment program 

On November 30, 2017, professional golfer John Patrick Mulligan pleaded guilty to a charge of driving while impaired and was sentenced to 12 months of probation. As part of his probation, Mulligan must participate in a treatment program.

Mulligan, who is 31 years old, was arrested in May 2017 after police found him slumped over the wheel of his car. He failed a field sobriety test and was subsequently charged with driving while impaired.

Mulligan is a 7-time winner on the PGA Tour and has earned more than $8 million in prize money. He is best known for his victory at the 2012 Honda Classic.

Mulligan released a statement following his sentencing, apologizing for his actions and vowing to do better in the future. "I'm grateful for this opportunity to get help and I'm committed to making positive changes in my life," he said. "I want to apologize to my family, friends, fans and all those affected by my actions. I know I have let you all down and I am sorry."

Mulligan's agent also issued a statement, saying that the golfer is currently seeking professional help for his drinking problem. "John is voluntarily seeking help from professionals and we support him 100 percent," the agent said. "We ask that everyone respect John's privacy during this time."

#  Mulligan says he's turning his life around after latest arrest 

Republican State Rep. Larry M. Mulligan Jr. of Arkansas says he is turning his life around after being arrested last month on weapons charges.

Mulligan, who has served in the state legislature since 2013, was booked into the Washington County jail on Feb. 22 on suspicion of felony possession of firearms and drugs, according to online records.

In a statement released to the media Wednesday, Mulligan said he is seeking counseling and treatment for drug and alcohol addiction and has "voluntarily surrendered all my firearms."

"I am committed to making things right and will continue to work hard for my constituents and the people of Arkansas," Mulligan said.

Mulligan's arrest came just days after he filed legislation seeking to expand gun rights in the state. House Bill 1288 would allow Arkansans with concealed carry permits to bring their firearms into churches and other places of worship.

The bill has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee but has not yet come up for a vote.

#  Former pro wrestler Mulligan faces sentencing in Georgia court 

Mulligan, a former professional wrestler, is awaiting sentencing in a Georgia court after pleading guilty to one count of felony aggravated battery.

The charge stems from an incident in which Mulligan attacked his ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend, leaving him with serious injuries.

Mulligan has apologized for his actions and has expressed remorse for the pain he has caused. He is expected to be sentenced to a term of imprisonment.

This is not Mulligan's first run-in with the law; he has a prior conviction for domestic violence. It is hoped that this latest incident will serve as a wake-up call and help him get the help he needs to address his anger issues.
