#  TGI Fridays' New Wing Roulette Platter is a Winner!

This week, TGI Fridays announced the launch of its new Wing Roulette Platter. This platter is an all-new, sharable menu item that features 16 wings in four different flavors: buffalo, honey BBQ, Caribbean jerk and Asian garlic.

As a fan of both wings and TGI Fridays, I was excited to try this new dish. The platter arrived at our table looking beautiful, with the four different wing flavors arranged in a circle around the perimeter. We dug in and each of us sampled a different flavor.

The buffalo wings were my favorite – they were spicy and flavorful without being too hot. The honey BBQ wings were also excellent, with a sweet and tangy glaze that was very tasty. The Caribbean jerk wings had a nice spicy kick to them, while the Asian garlic wings were a bit more subtle in flavor.

Overall, we all really enjoyed the Wing Roulette Platter and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fun, new way to enjoy wings. And at only $15.99 for a platter that feeds up to four people, it’s also a great value!
