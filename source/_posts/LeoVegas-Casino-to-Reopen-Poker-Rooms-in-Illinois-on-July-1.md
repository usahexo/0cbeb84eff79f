#  LeoVegas Casino to Reopen Poker Rooms in Illinois on July 1

After a nine-month hiatus, LeoVegas Casino is reopening its poker rooms in Illinois on July 1. The company closed the rooms last December amid concerns about the legality of online gambling in the state.

LeoVegas Casino spokesperson Kalle Freese said the company is confident that online gambling is legal in Illinois and that the poker rooms will reopen as planned.

“We have taken our time to review all the facts and are now confident in reopening our poker product in the market,” Freese said. “We remain fully committed to Illinois and believe there is great potential for growth in the market.”

The company did not say whether it plans to offer other casino games in Illinois beyond poker.

LeoVegas Casino is one of several companies that have been eyeing the potential for online gambling in Illinois. The state legalized online gambling late last year, but has yet to implement regulations governing the industry.

It is unclear when those regulations will be announced, but industry analysts expect them to be released later this year or early next year.

#  Poker Rooms in Illinois to Reopen at LeoVegas Casino on July 1

The largest poker room in Illinois is set to reopen at LeoVegas Casino on Tuesday, July 1. Players have been eagerly awaiting the reopening of the room, which closed in March amid allegations of illegal gambling.

Illinois Casino Gaming Association executive director George Hoeppner released a statement saying that the association has been working with law enforcement officials to ensure the integrity of the gaming at LeoVegas Casino. "We have been assured by law enforcement that they fully support our efforts and will be providing resources as needed to help us maintain a safe and secure environment for our players," said Hoeppner.

The poker room at LeoVegas Casino is one of the largest in the state, with 40 tables offering a variety of games including Texas Hold'em, Omaha Hi-Lo, and Seven Card Stud. The casino is also home to a $1 million guaranteed tournament each Sunday.

LeoVegas Casino is one of seven casinos in Illinois with a poker room; the others are Harrah's Joliet, Hollywood Casino Aurora, Hollywood Casino East Chicago, Argosy Alton, Par-A-Dice East Peoria, and Jumers Rock Island.

LeoVegas Casino is scheduled to reopen its poker rooms in Illinois starting July 1. According to Illinois Gaming Board spokeswoman Genevieve Marn, the casino operator has obtained a license to offer live poker games at its facility in Elgin, located about 40 miles northwest of Chicago.

The reopenings come more than two years after the state's Attorney General shut down all poker rooms in Illinois due to concerns over illegal gambling activities. At that time, the AG's office said it had "evidence of widespread criminal activity" at Illinois poker rooms, including money laundering and prostitution.

LeoVegas CEO Gustaf Hagman said the company is confident in its security measures and believes the new poker rooms will be a popular attraction for its customers. " We are looking forward to welcoming our players back to LeoVegas Casino Elgin and hope that they will enjoy our newly designed and renovated Poker Rooms," he said in a statement.

While LeoVegas is one of the first casinos to receive approval for live poker games since the crackdown, there are other operators who are also seeking licenses. If approved, those casinos would also be allowed to offer live poker games.

#  Leo Vegas Casino Ready to Open Up Poker Rooms in Illinois on July 1

Leo Vegas Casino is getting ready to open up poker rooms in Illinois on July 1. The casino has been in the process of getting approval from the state to operate the poker rooms, and they finally received it a few weeks ago.

The Leo Vegas Casino is a popular online casino that has been around for several years. The company decided to expand their business by opening up physical casinos, and they have been slowly expanding into new markets.

The poker rooms in Illinois will be located at the Leo Vegas Casino in East Chicago and the Leo Vegas Casino in Aurora. Both of these casinos are currently under construction, and they are expected to be completed in the next few weeks.

Once these poker rooms open, they will become some of the largest in Illinois. The East Chicago casino will have 33 tables, while the Aurora casino will have 24 tables. This will make them significantly larger than any other poker room in the state.

The Leo Vegas Casino is hoping that these poker rooms will help them become one of the top gambling destinations in Illinois. There are currently only a handful of casinos in the state, and most of them are small regional casinos.

The Leo Vegas Casino is hoping that their large poker rooms and expansive gaming selection will attract players from all over Illinois. They are also planning on offering some of the best promotions in the state, which should help them attract players as well.
