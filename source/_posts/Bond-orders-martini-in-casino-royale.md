#  Bond orders martini in casino royale

Bond orders a martini in casino royale. In his previous movies, bond has always ordered a vodka martini shaken, not stirred. However, in casino royale he orders a bourbon martini. This may be due to the fact that he is at a casino and wants to try something new.

#  What does Bond order in Casino Royale?

In the 2006 film Casino Royale, Agent James Bond orders a vodka martini "shaken, not stirred." So what does this mean? Is Bond asking for a particularly strong drink?

According to Ian Fleming's novels, from which the Bond films are derived, Bond's preference for shaken martinis is due to his belief that they are more effective as a weapon. "A shaken Martini distracts from the smell of gunpowder," he says. Fleming also notes that Bond prefers his martinis shaken because he likes them "very cold, very dry and with lots of vermouth."

So while Bond's order in Casino Royale might seem like an inside joke or simply a signature line, it actually has quite a bit of meaning behind it.

#  Bond's drink order revealed in Casino Royale

Fans of James Bond movies were treated to a new drink order from 007 in the latest installment, "Casino Royale." The martini-loving spy ordered a Vesper, made with vodka, Lillet Blanc and Kina Lillet.

Bond's drink was first mentioned in the 1953 novel "Casino Royale," by Ian Fleming. In the book, Bond orders a Vesper Martini, shaken not stirred. The drink is made with three measures of Gordon's gin, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake well until it's ice-cold, then add a slice of lemon peel.

Many have wondered what Lillet Blanc is and where to find it. It's a French apertif wine that is low in alcohol content (17% ABV). Kina Lillet is no longer produced, but there are substitutes that can be used. Aperol Spritz or Campari Soda work well as substitutes for Kina Lillet.

The Vesper has become quite popular among those who enjoy cocktails. bartender Jared Brown shared his recipe for the Vesper on his website Mixellany Ltd. His recipe calls for 1 3/4 ounces gin, 3/4 ounce vodka, 3/4 ounce Lillet Blanc and 2 dashes orange bitters. Shake all ingredients with cracked ice and strain into a chilled glass.

Whether you're a fan of Bond or not, the Vesper makes for an excellent cocktail choice for any occasion. It's light, refreshing and perfect for those hot summer days or nights out on the town.

#  New information about Bond's drink order in Casino Royale

In the 2006 film Casino Royale, James Bond orders a martini shaken, not stirred. But what many people don't know is that there's more to this drink order than simply 007 preferring his martinis shaken.

In fact, Bond's drink order is a reference to an old espionage saying. "Shaken, not stirred" is a play on the phrase "Double-Oh Seven", which is how Bond is referred to in some of Ian Fleming's novels. So by ordering his martini shaken, Bond is letting everyone know that he's in control and ready for anything.

Interestingly, there have been many arguments over the years about whether Bond should actually order his martinis shaken or stirred. Some believe that stirring a martini results in a better drink, while others think shaking it is the better option. In the end, it's really up to personal preference.

However you like your martinis, make sure to try one shaken, not stirred just like Bond!

#  Did you know Bond orders a martini in Casino Royale?

The very first time we see James Bond, he is in a casino — and he's drinking a martini. In the book Casino Royale, Ian Fleming writes:

"Bond ordered a dry martini, “straight up, with a twist.”"

Interestingly, this is not how Bond typically drinks his martinis. In many other scenes throughout the books and movies, Bond prefers his martinis "shaken, not stirred." So why did Fleming have Bond order a martini in this particular scene?

There are a few theories about this. One theory is that Fleming wanted to show that Bond was comfortable in any setting, no matter how elite or formal. This makes sense, especially since Bond is meeting Vesper Lynd for the first time in this scene. Another theory is that Fleming was making a statement about the class distinctions of the time. A dry martini was seen as a drink for high society, while shaken martinis were seen as more of a working class drink. By having Bond order a dry martini, Fleming was showing that he didn't care about these class distinctions — he was happy to order whatever drink he wanted, no matter where he was or who he was talking to.

Some people also believe that Fleming chose the drink because of its associations with masculinity. A martini is seen as an assertive drink — it's strong and it's not sweet like some other cocktails. By ordering one, Bond is sending a signal that he's not someone to be messed with.

Whatever the reason for Fleming's choice, it's clear that the martini has become closely associated with James Bond over the years. In fact, when people think of 007, they often picture him sipping on a cold martini straight up with a twist. And that's something we can all raise our glasses to.
