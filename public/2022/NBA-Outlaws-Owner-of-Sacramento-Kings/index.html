        <h1 id="NBA-Outlaws-Owner-of-Sacramento-Kings"><a href="#NBA-Outlaws-Owner-of-Sacramento-Kings" class="headerlink" title="NBA Outlaws Owner of Sacramento Kings"></a>NBA Outlaws Owner of Sacramento Kings</h1><p>The NBA Board of Governors unanimously approves the sale of the Sacramento Kings to a group led by Vivek Ranadive. The new, minority owner in the NBA is well known for his purchase of the Golden State Warriors in 2010 and serving as their CEO until he sold the team in July 2013. Ranadive is also the founder of Tibco Software, which he sold in 2014 for $4.3 billion. His investment firm, Ranadive Group, has purchased a controlling interest in Indian Premier League cricket team Sunrisers Hyderabad.</p>
<p>The Maloof family, who have been majority owners since 1998, will retain a small minority stake in the Kings after selling to Ranadive’s group for $534 million. The deal still needs to be approved by the NBA’s other owners, which is seen as a formality.</p>
<p>The Kings had been up for sale since January 2013 when the Maloofs reached an agreement to sell to hedge fund manager Chris Hansen and Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer for $525 million. That deal fell through in May 2013 when Hansen’s group failed to get approval from the city of Seattle to build a new arena.</p>
<p>Ranadive’s group includes 24 Hour Fitness founder Mark Mastrov, former Facebook executive Sean Parker, andzen investor Paul Jacobs.</p>
<h1 id="Sacramento-Kings-Sold-to-Isle-of-Capri-Casino-Owner"><a href="#Sacramento-Kings-Sold-to-Isle-of-Capri-Casino-Owner" class="headerlink" title="Sacramento Kings Sold to Isle of Capri Casino Owner"></a>Sacramento Kings Sold to Isle of Capri Casino Owner</h1><p>The Sacramento Kings were sold on Tuesday to the owners of the Isle of Capri Casino for $525 million. The Maloof family, who have owned the Kings since 1999, will retain a small ownership stake in the team.</p>
<p>The sale comes at a time when the Kings are making a resurgence in the NBA. This season, they finished with their best record in eight years and made it to the playoffs for the first time since 2006.</p>
<p>George Maloof, Sr., said that he and his brothers decided to sell the team because “it’s time for a change.” He also cited concerns about the ongoing NBA lockout as another reason for selling.</p>
<p>The new owners, a group led by businessman GeorgeJuan Vasquez, say that they plan to keep the team in Sacramento. However, they have not ruled out moving it if a new arena is not built.</p>
<p>Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson welcomed the news of the sale and vowed to continue working with the new ownership group to build a new arena for the Kings. He said that he was “thrilled that we have local ownership that cares deeply about our community and has exhibited a steadfast commitment to our city.”</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Mogul-Buys-Sacramento-Kings"><a href="#Casino-Mogul-Buys-Sacramento-Kings" class="headerlink" title="Casino Mogul Buys Sacramento Kings"></a>Casino Mogul Buys Sacramento Kings</h1><p>Philanthropist and casino mogul, Sheldon Adelson, has agreed to purchase the Sacramento Kings from the current owners. This move comes just days after the NBA rejected a bid from Chris Hansen to purchase the team and move it to Seattle.</p>
<p>Adelson is no stranger to professional sports, owning both the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino and the Sands Expo and Convention Center in Las Vegas. He is also the founder, chairman and CEO of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation, which is the world’s largest casino company.</p>
<p>The proposed purchase price for the Kings is $500 million, which would be a record for an NBA team. The current record is held by Miami Heat owner Micky Arison, who paid $285 million for his team in 1995.</p>
<p>Adelson has stated that he intends to keep the Kings in Sacramento and build them a new arena. The current home of the Kings, Sleep Train Arena, was built in 1988 and is one of the oldest arenas in the NBA.</p>
<h1 id="Wheeling-Island-Hotel-Casino-Racetrack-Owners-Buy-Sacramento-Kings"><a href="#Wheeling-Island-Hotel-Casino-Racetrack-Owners-Buy-Sacramento-Kings" class="headerlink" title="Wheeling Island Hotel-Casino-Racetrack Owners Buy Sacramento Kings"></a>Wheeling Island Hotel-Casino-Racetrack Owners Buy Sacramento Kings</h1><p>On Tuesday, the proprietors of Wheeling Island Hotel-Casino-Racetrack announced their intent to purchase the Sacramento Kings from the Maloof family. The $500 million deal, which is still subject to NBA approval, would make the West Virginia casino one of the NBA’s newest owners.</p>
<p>“This is a landmark day for Wheeling Island,” said Chuck Roadcap, CEO of parent company Penn National Gaming. “We are thrilled to have the opportunity to become part of the NBA and to invest in a first-class organization that is committed to its fans and its community.”</p>
<p>The Maloof family has been attempting to sell the Kings for years, and had reached an agreement late last year to sell the team to a group led by hedge fund manager Chris Hansen. That deal fell apart in May when the NBA’s Board of Governors rejected it by a wide margin.</p>
<p>Under the new agreement, Penn National Gaming would own a controlling interest in the team with Hansen retaining a minority stake. The deal is also contingent on Hansen securing approvals for a new arena in downtown Sacramento.</p>
<p>“We are excited about this new opportunity and proud to become part of such an esteemed league,” Roadcap said. “We look forward to working with our fellow NBA owners and doing whatever we can to support the Sacramento Kings and their wonderful fans.”</p>
<h1 id="Sacramento-Kings-Change-Hands-Again-This-Time-to-Illinois-Casino-Owners"><a href="#Sacramento-Kings-Change-Hands-Again-This-Time-to-Illinois-Casino-Owners" class="headerlink" title="Sacramento Kings Change Hands Again, This Time to Illinois Casino Owners"></a>Sacramento Kings Change Hands Again, This Time to Illinois Casino Owners</h1><p>The Sacramento Kings NBA franchise has changed hands once again, but this time the new buyers are from Illinois. The new owners of the team are the Principal owners of the Rivers Casino in Des Plaines, Illinois, Gary and concentrate their casino business in the Chicago area.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that a casino owner has bought an NBA franchise. Tilman Fertitta, who owns the Houston Rockets, is also the owner of Landry’s Inc., a casino and hospitality company. In addition, several NBA franchises have been sold to people with no prior connection to the sport or to professional sports teams. This list includes businessmen such as Tom Gores (Detroit Pistons), Dan Gilbert (Cleveland Cavaliers) and Herb Simon (Indiana Pacers).</p>
<p>What does this mean for the Sacramento Kings? The short answer is that it is too early to tell. But it is safe to say that there will be some changes in how the team is managed and in how it approaches its business operations. This could result in a different experience for fans attending Kings games at Golden 1 Center.</p>
<p>One possibility is that the new owners will be more aggressive in marketing the team and in trying to attract new fans. They may also be more inclined to invest in player personnel and in bringing in better players. Another possibility is that they will focus on making money by selling tickets, concessions and merchandise rather than on trying to win games.</p>
<p>Time will tell which of these outcomes materializes. In the meantime, we can only speculate about what lies ahead for one of California’s oldest professional sports franchises.</p>
