        <h1 id="Giants-Look-to-Add-Another-Win-in-Tight-Race-for-Playoff-Spot"><a href="#Giants-Look-to-Add-Another-Win-in-Tight-Race-for-Playoff-Spot" class="headerlink" title="Giants Look to Add Another Win in Tight Race for Playoff Spot"></a>Giants Look to Add Another Win in Tight Race for Playoff Spot</h1><p>The Giants (73-67) come into today’s game looking to add another win to their playoff push. They are currently in a tight race for the second Wild Card spot in the National League, and they are just 2.5 games back of the first Wild Card spot. The Giants have been playing well as of late, going 8-4 in their last twelve games.</p>
<p>They will be facing off against the Miami Marlins (53-87) today, who are in last place in the NL East. The Marlins have not been very good this season, and they have lost seven of their last ten games.</p>
<p>The Giants will send Madison Bumgarner (7-7, 3.09 ERA) to the mound today to face off against Dan Straily (9-10, 4.01 ERA). Straily has been good this season, but Bumgarner has been even better. Bumgarner has a 1.95 ERA in his last three starts, and he is coming off of a dominating performance against the Mets in which he threw eight shutout innings.</p>
<p>The Marlins will send Jose Urena (14-6, 3.82 ERA) to the mound today to face off against Bumgarner. Urena has been good this season, but he is coming off of a poor outing in which he gave up six runs in just four innings against the Nationals.</p>
<p>This should be an easy win for the Giants today as they take on one of the worst teams in baseball.</p>
<h1 id="Giants-Find-Another-Way-to-Win-Despite-Rough-Start"><a href="#Giants-Find-Another-Way-to-Win-Despite-Rough-Start" class="headerlink" title="Giants Find Another Way to Win Despite Rough Start"></a>Giants Find Another Way to Win Despite Rough Start</h1><p>The San Francisco Giants looked like they were in trouble after the first two games of their series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. They had been outscored 19-3 and their ace, Madison Bumgarner, had given up 10 runs in just 11 innings. However, they managed to win the next three games to take the series.</p>
<p>This was not the first time this season that the Giants have overcome a poor start. In fact, they have now won eight games in which they have been trailing by at least four runs. This is a testament to their never-give-up attitude and also to their depth.</p>
<p>The Giants were able to win this series even though they were without their MVP outfielder, Buster Posey, who is currently on the disabled list with a concussion. In his place, Andrew McBride got some key hits including a game-winning RBI double in Game 3.</p>
<p>Another player who stepped up for the Giants in this series was third baseman Pablo Sandoval. He hit .550 with two home runs and six RBIs in the four games.</p>
<p>The Giants will now head to Colorado for a three-game series against the Rockies. They will be looking to continue their winning streak and get back into first place in the NL West.</p>
<h1 id="Giants-Get-Boost-in-Playoff-Race-with-Solid-Road-Victory"><a href="#Giants-Get-Boost-in-Playoff-Race-with-Solid-Road-Victory" class="headerlink" title="Giants Get Boost in Playoff Race with Solid Road Victory"></a>Giants Get Boost in Playoff Race with Solid Road Victory</h1><p>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) – The San Francisco Giants got a much-needed boost in their playoff race, beating the Los Angeles Dodgers 4-2 on Wednesday for their first road win in nearly two months.</p>
<p>The Giants, who began the day 3 1&#x2F;2 games behind the NL West-leading Dodgers and a half-game out of the second NL wild card spot, had dropped 10 consecutive road games since winning at Philadelphia on July 25.</p>
<p>“It was a great team effort,” manager Bruce Bochy said. “We played well all day.”</p>
<p>Madison Bumgarner (14-8) pitched seven innings of one-run ball and improved to 5-1 with a 2.14 ERA in eight starts against Los Angeles this season. Hunter Strickland pitched a perfect eighth and Derek Law got three outs for his sixth save after closer Santiago Casilla gave up two runs in the ninth inning Tuesday night.</p>
<p>“It was a struggle but it feels good to finally get that one,” Bumgarner said of the road victory drought. “It’s better late than never.”</p>
<p> Adrian Gonzalez hit an RBI double off Bumgarner in the fourth inning and Justin Turner added a sacrifice fly for the Dodgers, who have lost four of six. Brandon McCarthy (6-4) allowed four runs – three earned – on nine hits in six innings.</p>
<p>“It was just one of those days,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. “ McCarthy was solid but we didn’t get it going offensively.”</p>
<p>The Giants took a 3-0 lead in the second inning on Gorkys Hernandez’s RBI single, Buster Posey’s sacrifice fly and Brandon Crawford’s RBI groundout. Posey also singled and doubled.</p>
<h1 id="Giants-remain-focused-down-the-stretch-find-another-way-to-win"><a href="#Giants-remain-focused-down-the-stretch-find-another-way-to-win" class="headerlink" title="Giants remain focused down the stretch, find another way to win"></a>Giants remain focused down the stretch, find another way to win</h1><p>SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. – The San Francisco Giants remain in first place in the National League West after a dramatic 3-2 win over the Colorado Rockies Sunday night.</p>
<p>Pablo Sandoval drove in the game-winning run with a sacrifice fly in the bottom of the ninth inning to give the Giants their fourth straight victory.</p>
<p>Despite the close call, the Giants feel good about their chances to win the division. “We’re just trying to focus on each game and not worry about what other teams are doing,” catcher Buster Posey said.</p>
<p>The Giants are still in control of their own destiny, and they know it. “We’ve just got to keep playing our game and see what happens,” left fielder Brandon Belt said.</p>
<p>The Giants have been winning with different lineups and different players stepping up in different ways. “That’s what makes this team so special,” center fielder Angel Pagan said. “We never give up.”</p>
<p>The Giants will look to keep things going when they host the Washington Nationals for a three-game series starting Tuesday night.</p>
<h1 id="Antwerp-Athletics-Giants-win-again-–-here’s-how-they-did-it"><a href="#Antwerp-Athletics-Giants-win-again-–-here’s-how-they-did-it" class="headerlink" title="Antwerp Athletics Giants win again – here’s how they did it"></a>Antwerp Athletics Giants win again – here’s how they did it</h1><p>The Antwerp Athletics Giants had an amazing season, smashing all previous records. The final game was incredibly tense, but the Giants pulled through and won, becoming the new champions!</p>
<p>The Giants’ secret to success is their incredible teamwork. They have a range of players with different skillsets, who work together to support one another. This allows them to make quick and effective plays that often surprise their opponents.</p>
<p>Their captain, Johan De Keyser, is an incredibly skilled player and a natural leader. He motivates his teammates and encourages them to always give their best effort. And it seems to be working – the team has now won 3 consecutive championships!</p>
<p>The Giants will be looking to retain their title next year, and there’s no doubt that they’ll be one of the favourites again. So if you want to see some top-quality athletics action, make sure you head down to Antwerp and catch a game!</p>
